</head>

Page content goes here

</body>
</html>

Img tag (<img src="filepathgoeshere">)



10.  Why do we use media queries?
A media query allows us to create style specifications when the screen hits a certain size so that we can make our websites look good on desktop, mobile, and tablet. Basically it allows for responsive design.



11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?
